## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## TechStack used
# Framer-motion
  Framer Motion is an animation library that makes creating animations easy. Its simplified API helps us abstract the complexities behind animations and allows us to create animations with ease.It was really fun to see all the cool animations and transitions taking place in the website.
# Tailwind css
   Got chance to use Tailwind css instead of all other available options, it was pretty good. Many utility classes are already present. Hope to use tailwind in next projects too.

## Dynamic Link of Website 
Hoisted the website using vercel, we can easily import our github repository and deploy our target branch in the server.
